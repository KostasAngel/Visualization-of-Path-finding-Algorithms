    allows updating of entries, and has built-in tie-breaking capabilities,
    i.e. when two entries have the same priority, the one added earlier is
    returned.

    Since it is not easy to replace an entry in the heap, they are
    instead marked as REMOVED in the separate entry_finder dictionary,
    and an updated entry is placed in the heap. REMOVED entries are
    filtered out when they are popped from the heap, and are found to
    be marked as such.

    A counter is used to mark when each entry was inserted in the queue,
    so that when more than one points have equal priority, the one
    inserted first is returned.

    Based on a combination of the following examples:
