# Visualization of Path Finding Algorithms

## Uninformed search strategies

### Breadth-First Search

#### Bidirectional Search
2 Breadth-First Searches, one starting from start, and one from goal. The algorithm stops when the two searches meet. 

### Depth-First Search

### Dijkstra's Algorithm

## Informed (heuristic) search strategies

### A* Search
